SIH-2022
This project was based on Smart India Hackathon 2022.

This was for the problem statement NK 831 given by INCOIS.

Our solution focuses on providing a methodical and an easy for users to access our
service which the fisherman will take the photo of the catch and the estimated fish proportions 
will be available to him. 
Apart from this if any endangered species like turtles, sharks enter the catch, they are immedeately notified 
to the government authorities and translated to the farmer in his official language respectively.

It has 2 logins:
-> Fisherman login
-> Government Id login


Apart from that the website includes :
-> India map showing fish catch in each harbor.
-> Analytics of fish catch in India over the last 35 years.
-> Fish stock assesment analytics.
-> Giving input to fisherman in which area there is currently high fish catch.
